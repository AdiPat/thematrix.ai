**An AI Simulation Playground Built on the Genesis Physics Engine**

---

## **About**

**TheMatrix.ai** is an interactive AI simulation platform designed to test and explore decision-making strategies in a dynamic, time-constrained environment. Powered by the **Genesis Physics Engine**, it simulates a virtual room where an agent must optimize its interactions with objects to maximize knowledge or value before being teleported to another dimension.

This project leverages cutting-edge AI techniques, including **Large Language Models (LLMs)**, to drive the agentâ€™s decision-making process. By experimenting with various selection strategies, **TheMatrix.ai** aims to explore the efficiency, adaptability, and performance of autonomous agents in simulated physical environments.

## **Gameplay**

1. **The Room**:
   - The agent begins in a virtual room containing multiple objects.
   - Each object has unique properties and interaction costs (known to the agent beforehand).
   - The agent can:
     - **Pick up objects**.
     - **Examine objects** to gather information.

2. **Time Constraint**:
   - The agent has a **fixed amount of time** in the room before it teleports to another dimension.
   - The agentâ€™s goal is to **make the best use of its time** by deciding which objects to interact with.

3. **LLM-Powered Decision-Making**:
   - The agent uses an **LLM** to determine the optimal sequence of actions (e.g., which object to interact with next).
   - The LLM's processing time is **not included** in the countdown timer, allowing for experimentation with various strategies.

4. **Evaluation**:
   - Agents are evaluated based on:
     - The **value** or **knowledge** gained during the session.
     - The **efficiency** of their decision-making process.
     - The **total cost** incurred during interactions.

## **Key Features**

- **Physics-Driven Simulation**: Built on the Genesis Physics Engine, providing realistic object properties and interactions.
- **LLM-Integrated Strategy**: Incorporates Large Language Models for decision-making and planning.
- **Flexible Time Management**: Allows for experimenting with various strategies under fixed time constraints.
- **Customizable Objects**: Each object can be assigned unique properties, interaction costs, and hidden information.
- **Experimental Framework**: Compare LLM-based strategies with traditional AI approaches like **heuristic search** or **classical AI algorithms** (e.g., A*).

## **How It Works**

1. **Environment Setup**:
   - A room is simulated with objects of varying properties.
   - Objects have a predefined **interaction cost** and may reveal information upon examination.

2. **Agent's Objective**:
   - Maximize the value or knowledge gained by interacting with the most "valuable" objects.

3. **Decision Process**:
   - The agent queries an LLM for recommendations on which object to interact with next.
   - The LLM bases decisions on:
     - Interaction costs.
     - Estimated value of the object.
     - Time remaining.

4. **Teleportation**:
   - Once the time runs out, the agent is teleported to another dimension, ending the session.

## **Planned Experiments**

1. **Comparison of Strategies**:
   - Test the agent's performance with different LLM prompting techniques.
   - Compare LLM-based decision-making to traditional methods like A* or rule-based heuristics.

2. **Dynamic Environments**:
   - Introduce random events or changing object properties during the simulation.

3. **Scalability**:
   - Expand from single-room simulations to multi-room or open-world environments.

4. **Collaborative Agents**:
   - Introduce multiple agents working together to maximize shared goals.
